# About

I built this as a last minute ðŸŽ„ Christmas ðŸŽ„ present for my mom. She often reads Chinese stories on Firefox on her tablet. Unfortunately, even the maximum text zoom is too small for her and strains her eyes. [1]

"That's bullshit!", I exclaimed! I can FTFY with Greasemonkey! Oops. Turns out Greasemonkey isn't supported on Firefox for Android. #sadness.

After much grumbling and searching it turned out a custom add-on would do the trick!

## How I built it

* Started at [Firefox's Add-On SDK docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/SDK) and installed the `cfx` command line utility
* Using the [page-mod SDK](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/SDK/High-Level_APIs/page-mod), I run a custom script, [resizer.js](https://github.com/mostlygeek/millionbook-firefox-addon/blob/master/data/resizer.js) on the [millionbook.com](http://millionbook.com) website
* `resizer.js` adds a floating button, that when clicked will change an inline css style to resize the font. It will also remember the last zoom level across pages.
* Here's how it looks: (*I don't read Chinese so if text is NSFW, oops!*)![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mostlygeek/millionbook-firefox-addon/master/screenshots/1.png?a)
* Built into an XPI file for Android: `$ cfx xpi --force-mobile`
* Put it into my Dropbox and bit.ly linked it: [http://bit.ly/_millionbook](http://bit.ly/_millionbook) so I can open it on the tablet
* \o/
