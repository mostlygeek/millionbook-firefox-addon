# About

I built this as a last minute ðŸŽ„ Christmas ðŸŽ„ present for my mom. She often reads Chinese stories on Firefox on her tablet. Unfortunately, even the maximum text zoom is too small for her and strains her eyes. [1]

"That's bullshit!", I exclaimed! I can FTFY with Greasemonkey! Oops. Turns out Greasemonkey isn't supported on Firefox for Android. #sadness.

After much grumbling and searching it turned out a custom add-on would do the trick!

## How I built it

* Started at [Firefox's Add-On SDK docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/SDK) and installed the `cfx` command line utility
* Using the [page-mod SDK](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/SDK/High-Level_APIs/page-mod), I run a custom script, [resizer.js](https://github.com/mostlygeek/millionbook-firefox-addon/blob/master/data/resizer.js) on the [millionbook.com](http://millionbook.com) website
* `resizer.js` adds a floating button, that when clicked will change an inline css style to resize the font. It will also remember the last zoom level across pages.
* Here's how it looks: (*I don't read Chinese so if text is NSFW, oops!*)![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mostlygeek/millionbook-firefox-addon/master/screenshots/1.png?a)
* Built into an XPI file for Android: `$ cfx xpi --force-mobile`
* Put it into my Dropbox and bit.ly linked it: [http://bit.ly/_millionbook](http://bit.ly/_millionbook) so I can open it on the tablet

## How to work on it 

* See [Developing extension for Firefox for Android](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/developing-extensions-for-firefox-for-android/)
* Need to have an Android emulator installed 
* Create a Tablet sized virtual machine, enable Android Developer Mode
* Testing it
  * in android emulator:  
    * use Android Studio GUI to create a new tablet emulator    
    * use `~/Library/Android/sdk/emulator`: `./emulator -list-avds`, `./emulator -avd XXXX` to start one
    * use `adb devices` to find id of running emulators
    * `web-ext run -t firefox-android --android-device=emulator-XXXX` to run in Firefox in emulator. Firefox Beta must be installed.  Android Developer mode + USB debugging must be enabled. Remote debugging via USB must be enabled in Firefox. 
  * on Desktop: `web-ext run` - to test locally 
* Building it: `web-ext build`
